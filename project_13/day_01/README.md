### Why DB Software?
1. We don't want to deal with it ourselves. We're lazy.
2. ATOMic transactions. Its very hard to ensure that when someone asks to write data somewhere, it gets written there. We will always succeed or fail - similar to a promise - there is no middleground e.g. corrupt state, race conditions, etc.
3. It provides a very simple language for us to write and retrieve data.
   - SQL: Structured Query Language
4. SQL structures relationships between data.
