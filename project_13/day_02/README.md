### Tips using your editor with bigger projects:
- Use CMD + Shift + F to search across multiple files.
- console.log AND call your functions early and often.
- Commit early and often.  
  - Commit only working code.  That way you can use your diff to debug: 
  - Look at what you have changed and what broke since it was working.
